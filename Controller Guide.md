## 🕹️ Default Layout

By default, the controller is mapped according to **Layout 406**:

> You can view this layout anytime at:  
> `Journals of Jyggalag\mods\Complete Controller Setup\Layout 406.jpg`

## ⚙️ Customizing the Controller Setup

If you'd like to change how the controls are mapped:

1. In **MO2**, find `Complete Controller Setup` in your left panel
2. Right-click it > **Reinstall**
3. The FOMOD will launch again and let you choose alternate configurations

> ⚠️ **Note:** The current layout was hand-picked for compatibility with other mods in the list. Changing the setup may require adjusting other settings. This falls under **Rule 11** — changes are at your own risk.

## 📜 Wheeler Setup

**Wheeler** is a radial menu system designed for gamepads.

- Visit the [Wheeler Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345) for in-depth usage instructions.
- Refer to the diagram above for default button assignments.

> 💡 **In-game:** Press the `Home` key on your keyboard to open **dMenu**, which provides Wheeler customization options such as wheel behavior and slot assignment.

The controller layout image (`Layout 406.jpg`) will **update in MO2** based on any changes you make in the FOMOD.

## 🧙 Character Creation and Progression

### Race Selection
- Your choice of race determines:
  - Racial bonuses
  - Available deities for worship
  - Standing Stone bonuses
- Recommended reading before character creation:
  - [Mannaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87219)
  - [Freyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88043)
  - [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)
- **Do not** use console commands to change your race after creation.

---

### OBody and Character Appearance
- Your character may appear **distorted or incorrect** in RaceMenu. This is expected.
- **Do not** attempt to adjust body morphs in RaceMenu — the list uses **OBody**.
- After finalizing your character:
  - Press `O` (default hotkey) to bring up the **OBody** BodySlide preset selector.
    - If you're **not targeting** anything, the preset will apply to **your player character**.
    - If you're **targeting an NPC**, the preset will apply to **that NPC**.
- This system ensures correct body shapes and is preferred over manual RaceMenu edits.

---

### Starting Room Behavior

- Once you enter the game:
  - Your character will load into a small setup room.
  - A **JOJ Welcome message** will pop up immediately — this explains that the list is performing initial setup in the background and that **you must wait**.
  - Do **not** move or interact with anything while configuration messages appear.
  - Walk away from your keyboard, let everything initialize, and wait for the final confirmation message.
  - Once you see the popup that says **“Museum is done setting up,”** it’s safe to proceed.

---

### Starting Tools and Options
- Items found in the starting room:
  - A copy of **The Firmament**: lets you choose any Standing Stone.
  - A **Vanity Mirror**: lets you change your appearance at any time.
- Exit options:
  - Speak to the dragon to choose an **alternate start**.
  - Exit the door to begin in Helgen as a **spectator** to the execution.
  - Press the **hidden button behind the table** to begin just after Helgen.

---

### Leveling and Experience System
- Vanilla leveling has been **replaced** with:
  - **Experience** (XP gained from exploration, combat, and quests)
  - **Static Skill Leveling** (skill points spent manually at level-up)
- This means:
  - No more grinding skills like smithing or lockpicking.
  - You're free to play naturally without being penalized for your actions.

#### Recommended early-game skill strategy:
- Choose:
  - 1 offensive skill
  - 1 defensive skill
  - 1 crafting or utility skill
- Expand to additional skills as you gain more points through leveling.

---

### 💎 Skyshards and Destiny Points

- **Boss chests** may contain **Skyshards**:  
  - Use them from your inventory to **gain extra XP**.

- You can also encounter **glowing Skyshards** while exploring the world:  
  - Touching **three** of these will grant you **one perk point**.

- **Destiny Points**:  
  - Awarded at **character creation** and **milestone levels**  
  - Activate the **“Destiny” power** in your powers menu to access a unique progression tree

---

### Difficulty Notes
- **Combat is intentionally difficult** at low levels.
- Suggested approach:
  - Use a follower early on.
  - Explore and level up before entering dungeons or bandit caves.
- Enemy scaling examples:
  - Bandit zones: minimum level 5
  - Draugr zones: minimum level 10
 
---

## 🧭 Questing

This list includes expansions of many vanilla quests as well as quite a few new ones. Most of these can be explored simply by encountering them through normal gameplay, or you can check the quest list in **Mod Organizer** to see if there's something you want to make a point of seeking out.

### General Advice
- Many new quests will activate **organically** during exploration.
- For guidance or spoilers, you can:
  - Check the installed mod list in MO2
  - Look through the “Quests” category to see what’s been added

---

### Vicn Questline

The **Vicn series of quests** require more specific preparation and progression. To access this interconnected storyline, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites:
1. Begin the **main quest** and learn all three words of **Unrelenting Force**.
2. Become the **Archmage of Winterhold**.
3. Complete **Arniel's Endeavors** and find the **Tools of Kagrenac**.
4. Acquire the **Oghma Infinium** and the **Wabbajack**.
5. Claim the **Helm of Yngol** from Yngol Barrow.
6. Obtain the **Staff of Worms** from Gallows Hall.

#### Once completed:
- You will encounter strange events near **Solitude**.
- This will begin the first Vicn quest mod: **Dac0da**.
- Completing Dac0da will unlock:
  - **Vigilant**
  - **Glenmoril**
  - **Unslaad**

These quests are large, story-rich expansions with unique environments and mechanics. Approach them when you are ready for long-form, high-difficulty content.

## 🗡️ 3rd Person Combat Stances

### Overview

Journals of Jyggalag introduces a **stance system** for third-person combat. These stances change:
- Your character’s **animations**
- The **effectiveness, rhythm, and style** of your combat abilities

Whether you're wielding swords, great hammers, bows, or spells, stances allow you to tailor your combat experience and adapt to different threats.

### How to Use
- **Assigned Hotkey**: `X`
- You can switch stances:
  - **Anytime**, even during combat
  - To match enemy types or your playstyle

Stances are **not tied to specific classes**, but offer tools to customize your approach.

---

## 🧍 Stance Options

### Bear Stance
A heavy-hitting stance focused on overwhelming force.

**Effects:**
- Melee attacks and Destruction spells deal **+25% damage**
- You take **+15% melee damage**
- Works well with:
  - Large weapons
  - Ranged Destruction casting
  - Risk-reward melee builds

---

### Wolf Stance
A stamina-based stance that emphasizes pressure and bleeding effects.

**Requirements:**
- Bonuses apply **only if stamina is above 35%**

**Effects with sharp weapons (swords, daggers, bows, greatswords, axes, greataxes):**
- **–15% damage** to non-undead targets
- Inflict **Bleed**: 2 damage per second for 5 seconds

**Notes:**
- No bonuses for mages
- Has **no effect** on maces or greathammers

---

### Hawk Stance
A mobility-focused stance built for speed and hybrid playstyles.

**Effects:**
- Stamina and magicka regenerate **+70% faster**
- Power attacks cost **+20% more stamina**
- Ideal for:
  - Fast weapons
  - Mobile builds
  - Hybrid casters or evasive characters

---

## 🪓 Dynamic Grip

### Overview

Journals of Jyggalag includes the **Dynamic Grip** mod, allowing you to switch between **one-handed** and **two-handed grips** on the fly—even mid-combat.

For example:
- Equip a greatsword in one hand to cast spells
- Switch back to two-handed mode for full damage output

This gives you more flexibility and synergy between weapon types and magic.

---

### How to Change Grip

- **Default Hotkey**: `G`
  - You can customize this in `DynamicGrip.ini`

---

### Gameplay Effects

#### Two-Handed Grip (while using a one-handed weapon):
- **+30% damage bonus**
- **Increased attack speed**

#### One-Handed Grip (while using a two-handed weapon):
- **–30% damage penalty**
- **Reduced attack speed**

---

### Perk Behavior

- **Perks apply based on weapon type, not grip mode**:
  - One-handed perks affect only **naturally one-handed weapons**
  - Two-handed perks affect only **naturally two-handed weapons**
- Gripping a two-handed sword with one hand does **not** make it eligible for one-handed perks

---

### Customizing the Hotkey

To change the grip hotkey:
1. Navigate to the `SKSE/Plugins` folder in your MO2 Data tab
2. Open the `DynamicGrip.ini` file
3. Replace the default hotkey with your preferred **scancode**

Useful reference: [Input Script Scancode List](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script)

---

### Known Issues

- **Not all weapons** will react reliably to grip changes.
  - If issues occur, **unequip and re-equip** the weapon
- **Incompatible mod: Wheeler**
  - Shares the same default keybind
  - Listed as incompatible on its mod page
  - **Recommendation**: Disable Wheeler if using Dynamic Grip

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Face & Appearance Issues

### Problem: Black Face or Unexpected Tattoos

You may notice:
- Your character's face turns black
- Unwanted or strange facial tattoos appear

These are usually caused by:
- RaceMenu misfires
- Texture or facegen desync

---

### Solution: Vanity Mirror (Preferred)

If you received the **Vanity Mirror** in the starting room:

1. Open your **Inventory**
2. Click on the **Vanity Mirror**
3. This will open **RaceMenu**
4. Press `R` to finalize and confirm your appearance
5. Your character’s face should now display correctly

---

### Alternative Fix: Using Console

If you **did not** get the Vanity Mirror:

1. Press the **`~` key** (tilde, left of `1`) to open the console
2. Type: `showracemenu` and press Enter
3. Press `~` again to close the console
4. Press `R` to finalize your appearance
5. Hit **Enter** to confirm and exit

This forces RaceMenu to reapply facegen data and should fix any visual glitches.

---

## 🗺️ Map Marker Issues

### Problem: “I’m at a map marker, but there’s nothing here!”

This is a known issue caused by **Soul Cairn markers** from the Atlas MCM.

---

### Solution: Disable Soul Cairn Markers

1. Open the **Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)**
2. Navigate to the **Atlas** settings
3. Go to the **Vanilla** section
4. **Disable** the set of markers for the **Soul Cairn**

This will remove the “?” markers from your world map and prevent confusion while exploring.

---

## 🧾 NPC Names

This modlist uses **NPC’s Names Distributor** to ensure that all NPCs — even generic ones like bandits — have unique names. However, to preserve immersion, you won’t see these names until you interact directly with them.

For example:
- Until you talk to or attack an NPC, they’ll appear as “Nord Man” or “Bandit Plunderer”
- After interaction, their custom name is revealed

If you want to override this behavior:

- Press `Right Ctrl + O`  
  - This will **reveal all names immediately**, instead of waiting for interaction
  - Note: This keybind also opens the **OBody menu** — simply press `Esc` to cancel the OBody menu if it appears

- Press `Right Ctrl + N`  
  - This will **disable custom names entirely** and revert everyone to generic titles (e.g., “Bandit Plunderer”)

These features allow you to choose between immersive name discovery and full name visibility.

---

## 🐻 Skinning Mechanics

This is controlled by Simple Hunting Overhaul. It doesn't have an ini but does support some custom console commands. From the modpage:

You can disable the skinned animal look by typing `Set _RemovePelts to 0`,  
You can disable the need for a permit by typing `Set _EnablePermits to 0`,  
You can disable the time passing + fadeout effect of looting by typing `Set _FadeTimePass to 0`,  
You can disable the time passing of looting by typing `Set _FadeTimePass to 2`,  
You can disable the fadeout effect of looting by typing `Set _FadeTimePass to 3`,

For the love of Talos, please notice that there's a space between `set` and `_`.

---

## 🏃 Change Dodge Key

By default, dodging is triggered by tapping your Sprint key. If you want to change this behavior, you’ll need to manually edit the TK Dodge configuration file.

To do this, open Mod Organizer 2, go to the right-hand pane, and navigate to the **Data** tab. Locate the active version of `TK Dodge RE.ini`. Right-click the file and select **Open**.

Inside the file, change the following lines:

`EnableSprintKeyDodge = false`
`Dodge hotkey = [your desired key's scancode]`


Make sure to replace `[your desired key's scancode]` with the actual scancode of the key you want to assign. Note that the scancode link provided in the `.ini` file is outdated. For an accurate list, refer to: https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script

**Important:** Do not enable `StepDodge`. It is not compatible with the combat systems used in this modlist and will break functionality.

---

## 📜 VICN Quest Requirements

To commence the Vicn questline, you must:

- Begin the main quest and learn all three words of **Unrelenting Force**,  
- Become the **Archmage of Winterhold**, complete all of **Arniel's Endeavors**, and find the **Tools of Kagrenac**,  
- Acquire the **Oghma Infinium** and the **Wabbajack**,  
- Claim the **Helm of Yngol** from his barrow,  
- Obtain the **Staff of Worms** from **Gallows Hall**.

With all that complete, you will soon discover strange matters afoot near **Solitude**, and be able to begin **Dac0da**. Completing that quest will lead in turn to **Vigilant**, **Glenmoril**, and **Unslaad**.

---

## 🏠 Player Homes

In addition to the Vanilla and AE homes included in the base game, this list adds the following custom housing locations:

- [LOTD Safehouse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)  
- [Aemer's Refuge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4751)
- [Mirele Bismath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93817) 
- [BBLS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95197)
- [The Interdimensional Chambers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47778)  
- [Leveler's Tower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2692)
    
- **Breaking Dawn**, **New Moon**, and **Eclipse Cottages** from **Cities of the North**

These homes vary in style and function, from immersive lore-friendly dwellings to utility-packed player bases. All are fully compatible with the modlist and available once discovered in-game.

---

## 🚫 Fast Travel Disabled

Can’t fast travel?

You’ve likely enabled survival mode through **Sunhelm**. By default, survival mode disables fast travel completely.

To re-enable it, open the **Sunhelm MCM** from the Mod Configuration Menu.  
From there, you have two options:

- Re-enable **fast travel** directly  
- Or disable **survival mode** altogether

Either option will restore your ability to fast travel.

---

## 💀 Death Alternatives

There is no death alternative included in the list by default, but we encourage you to select and add one of your own choosing.

**Save corruption is a real risk** in Skyrim, but every player has different preferences for how death should be handled. Rather than force a specific system, we leave it up to you to decide what fits your playstyle.

A partial list of popular death alternative mods includes:

- **Shade of Mortality**  
- **Shadow of Skyrim**  
- **Acheron**  
- **Stay in the Fight**  
- **Soul Resurrection**

If you’d like help picking one or getting it working correctly, feel free to ask in the **Rule 11** chat channel on our Discord.

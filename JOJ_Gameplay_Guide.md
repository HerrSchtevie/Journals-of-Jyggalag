## Character Creation & Starting Area

### Race Selection
- Your **race** determines:
  - Racial passives and starting stats.
  - **Standing Stone compatibility** (via **Mannaz**).
  - **Deity access** and blessings (via **Wintersun**).
- Recommended reading:
  - [Mannaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46545)
  - [Freyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46555)
  - [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)

> ⚠️ **Never use console commands to change your race after creation.** It may break scripts, perks, deity alignments, and more.

### Initial Load & Auto-Configuration
When you first enter the game:
1. You will load into a **small starting room**.
2. Various setup popups from MCM and core mods will begin to appear.
3. **DO NOT move or interact** with your character during this.

#### What to do instead:
- Walk away from the PC.
- Let the scripts finish (takes 30–90 seconds).
- Wait for a popup that says **“Museum is done setting up.”**
- Only interact once that appears.

### Features in the Start Room
- **The Firmament**: Choose your initial Standing Stone.
- **Vanity Mirror**: Opens RaceMenu for appearance tweaks.
- Several containers with optional starting gear.

### Choosing Your Start
You have three start options:
1. **Speak to the Dragon** – Choose from a list of alternate starts.
2. **Exit through the door** – Witness the **Helgen execution** sequence.
3. **Push the button behind the table** – Skip Helgen and begin in the world.

## Leveling & Progression Systems

### Static Skill Leveling
- The modlist **removes vanilla skill-use leveling**.
- You **do not gain XP** from using skills like in vanilla.
- Instead, you gain XP from:
  - **Combat**
  - **Exploration**
  - **Quests**

When you level up:
- You are given a number of **skill points**.
- These points can be assigned to **any skill**, regardless of use.

### Progression Advice
- In early game, focus on:
  - **1 Offensive Skill** (e.g. One-Handed, Destruction)
  - **1 Defensive Skill** (e.g. Block, Alteration)
  - **1 Utility/Crafting Skill** (e.g. Speech, Smithing, Alchemy)

### Skyshards
- Boss chests may contain a **Skyshard** item.
- **Use it in your inventory** to gain **+1 perk point**.

### Destiny Points
- Awarded at **character creation** and **certain level milestones**.
- Use the **"Destiny" Power** in your Magic > Powers menu.
- Opens a **custom specialization tree**.

### Difficulty Warning
- Early combat is **intentionally challenging**.
- Enemy zone minimum levels:
  - **Bandits**: Level 5+
  - **Draugr**: Level 10+
- Consider:
  - Gaining a few levels first.
  - Equipping a follower.
  - Avoiding dungeons until prepared.

## Questing & VICN Series

JOJ includes numerous quest expansions and completely new storylines. Many of these will appear naturally as you explore the world, but the VICN series of quest mods has specific unlock conditions and is designed as a late-game sequence.

### General Quest Additions
- Several vanilla questlines have been expanded with new stages, choices, or consequences.
- Additional content from mods like **3DNPC**, **Amorous Adventures**, **Wyrmstooth**, and others are integrated.
- Use **MO2** to explore the full list of included quest plugins if you're searching for something specific.

### VICN Questline Overview
To unlock the **VICN quest saga** (which includes *Dac0da*, *Vigilant*, *Glenmoril*, and *Unslaad*), you must complete a sequence of milestone achievements.

#### Prerequisite Checklist:
1. Begin the **Main Quest** and learn all three words of **Unrelenting Force**.
2. Become **Archmage of Winterhold**.
3. Complete **Arniel’s Endeavors** (College of Winterhold quest).
4. Find the **Tools of Kagrenac**.
5. Acquire the **Oghma Infinium** (from Hermaeus Mora) and **Wabbajack** (from Sheogorath).
6. Claim the **Helm of Yngol** from Yngol Barrow.
7. Obtain the **Staff of Worms** from **Gallows Hall**.

Once these are completed:

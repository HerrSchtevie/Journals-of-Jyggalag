Additionally, the following software must be installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)


## üî• Installation Instructions

### ‚ùó Important

- **Anniversary Edition (AE) and Creation Kit are hard requirements.** This modlist will not work correctly with Standard Skyrim Special Edition (SSE), and will not download correctly without Creation Kit.

1. **Download Wabbajack** from [Wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org/) if you have not already.
2. **Create a clean installation of Skyrim Anniversary Edition (AE required). Plenty of great video tutorials on this: [GamerPoets Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1QyAj4c564&ab_channel=GamerPoets)**
3. **Open Wabbajack** and search for **Journals of Jyggalag (JOJ)** in the modlist browser.
4. **Click on the JOJ modlist** and choose your installation directory. The installation and downloads do not have to be on the same drive, but the installtion MUST be on a SSD.
5. **Click Start** and wait for the installation to complete. Wabbajack will handle the entire process automatically.

### Post-Installation Steps

1. **Open MO2 from your Journals of Jyggalag installation folder.**

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Important: Disable NPC Overhaul Mods Before Playing

**BEFORE launching the game**, open MO2 and scroll down to the section labeled **EasyNPC** (highlighted with a blue separator).

- **Disable every mod in this section** (do **not** delete them‚Äîjust uncheck the boxes).
- These mods are included to give you full control over NPC appearances using EasyNPC.
- If left enabled, they will **conflict with the merged NPC output** and cause visual bugs or missing NPCs.

3. **Select Journals of Jyggalag from the dropdown in the top right (it should be default be selected).**
4. **Click 'Run' and enjoy!**

Please ensure your Skyrim installation is set to [English](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/651/~/how-do-i-change-the-language-in-skyrim%3F) and confirm at least 573 GB of available storage on your drive. After installation completes, you can delete the downloads folder to free additional space.

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

### üß† Gameplay Tips

- **Ultrawide Monitors:**  
  JOJ is configured for 16:9 monitors by default. If you use a 21:9 or 32:9 display (like me ‚Äî #ultrawidemasterrace), you‚Äôll need to **rerun the FOMOD installers** for the following mods to select the appropriate widescreen options:
  - `Dear Diary Dark Mode (white text)`
  - `Untarnished UI 1.1.6`
  - `The Elder Scrolls Legends - Loading Screens`  
  These mods are marked with notes inside MO2 reminding you to rerun the FOMOD if needed.

- **Blue Separator Load Order Markers:**  
  Throughout MO2, you‚Äôll see several sections marked with **blue separators**. These aren‚Äôt meant to be tweaked heavily, but rather serve as organized areas where you can safely **add mods**, **adjust settings**, or insert patches without interfering with core list functionality. Examples include NPC visual mods, controller patches, or custom camera tweaks.

- **Disabling 32:9 Patch:**  
  If you‚Äôre not on a 32:9 monitor, make sure to **disable** the mod:
  - `32x9 Patch for Hotkey Reminder`  
  Found under the `Controller Support` separator.

- **Keyboard & Mouse Users:**  
  If you don‚Äôt plan to use a controller, you can safely **disable**:
  - `Gamepad++`
  - `Complete Controller Setup`  
  These are also found under the `Controller Support` separator.

These small tweaks help tailor the list to your exact setup ‚Äî especially for widescreen users or those who prefer a traditional keyboard + mouse experience.

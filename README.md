## üî• Installation Instructions

| Skyrim & Anniversary Edition Setup | Mandatory | Details & Guidance |
|------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Clean Skyrim Installation (EN)** | ‚úÖ        | Skyrim must be installed in English and placed outside protected folders (avoid "Program Files"). Recommended location: drive root (e.g., `C:\Skyrim`). Follow [Steam's guide](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327) to move your game. For language setup, see [Bethesda‚Äôs language guide](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/651/~/how-do-i-change-the-language-in-skyrim%3F). |
| **Skyrim AE Upgrade**              | ‚úÖ        | The $20 Anniversary Edition upgrade from Steam is mandatory. Standard Special Edition or the free CC content update will not suffice. |

| Required Accounts                  | Mandatory | Account Information |
|------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Nexus Mods Account**             | ‚úÖ        | You must create a basic Nexus Mods account prior to installation. |
| **Nexus Premium Subscription**     | ‚ùå        | Premium account is highly recommended. Without Premium, installation may take significantly longer, potentially extending installation by many hours or even days. |

| PC Adjustments & System Requirements | Mandatory | Detailed Instructions |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Visual Studio (2015‚Äì2022)**        | ‚úÖ        | Required runtime libraries from Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 are essential for Mod Organizer 2 and specific mods to function properly. |
| **600 GB Free SSD Space**            | ‚úÖ        | The full installation (modlist + temporary files) requires approximately 600 GB. Final size is about 450 GB; temporary downloads can be deleted or relocated after installation to recover around 150 GB. |
| **OneDrive Disabled or Removed**     | ‚úÖ        | Fully uninstall or disable OneDrive, as it locks essential Skyrim files and causes errors during gameplay. |
| **Pagefile Adjusted to 40 GB**       | ‚úÖ        | Adjust your system's virtual memory (pagefile) to a fixed size of 40 GB (40,960 MB) to ensure stability and prevent crashes. Instructions for Windows 11 can be found [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-change-virtual-memory-size-on-windows-11). Similar methods apply to other Windows versions. |

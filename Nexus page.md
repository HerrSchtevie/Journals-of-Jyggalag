## 📖 What is *Journals of Jyggalag*?

**Journals of Jyggalag (JOJ)** is a fully automated Wabbajack modlist for Skyrim Special Edition that transforms the game into a stunning, lore-rich, and erotic adventure across Tamriel. 

Featuring full integration of adult content, complete visual overhauls, quest expansions, and refined combat, JOJ creates an immersive, replayable experience for players who want both intensity and intimacy. Built on the bones of the vanilla world, this is Skyrim reimagined — darker, deeper, and far more dangerous.
